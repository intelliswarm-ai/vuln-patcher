### Contributing Code

#### First-Time Contributors

Look for issues labeled with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are great starting points for new contributors.

#### Areas We Need Help

- **New Vulnerability Sources**: Adding support for additional vulnerability databases
- **Language Support**: Adding fix generators for new programming languages
- **AI Improvements**: Enhancing the AI agents and fix generation
- **Performance**: Optimizing scanning and processing speed
- **Documentation**: Improving guides and API documentation
- **Testing**: Adding more unit and integration tests
- **UI/UX**: If we add a web interface in the future

## Development Process

### 1. Create an Issue

Before starting work, create an issue describing what you plan to do. This helps avoid duplicate work and allows for discussion.

### 2. Work on Your Feature

```bash
# Keep your fork up to date
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Run tests
mvn test

# Check code quality
mvn spotless:check
mvn spotbugs:check
```

### 3. Write Tests

All new features must include tests:

```java
@QuarkusTest
class YourFeatureTest {
    
    @Test
    void testYourFeature() {
        // Given
        // When
        // Then
    }
}
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add/update JavaDoc comments
- Update configuration guides if adding new properties
- Add examples if introducing new features

## Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style

We follow the Google Java Style Guide with some modifications:

```java
// Package statement
package ai.intelliswarm.vulnpatcher.service;

// Import statements (ordered)
import ai.intelliswarm.vulnpatcher.model.Vulnerability;

import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheRepository;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Service for managing vulnerabilities.
 * 
 * @author Your Name
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class VulnerabilityService {
    
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(VulnerabilityService.class);
    
    @Inject
    VulnerabilityRepository repository;
    
    /**
     * Finds vulnerabilities by severity.
     * 
     * @param severity the severity level
     * @return list of vulnerabilities
     */
    public List<Vulnerability> findBySeverity(String severity) {
        LOGGER.debug("Finding vulnerabilities with severity: {}", severity);
        return repository.find("severity", severity).list();
    }
}
```

### Code Conventions

1. **Naming**:
   - Classes: `PascalCase`
   - Methods/Variables: `camelCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
   - Packages: `lowercase`

2. **Formatting**:
   - Indentation: 4 spaces
   - Line length: 120 characters
   - Always use braces for if/for/while

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Prefer immutability
   - Use Optional for nullable returns
   - Leverage Quarkus DI
   - Write reactive code where possible

### Testing Guidelines

```java
@QuarkusTest
class ServiceTest {
    
    @Inject
    Service service;
    
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should successfully process valid input")
    void testValidInput() {
        // Given
        String input = "valid";
        
        // When
        Result result = service.process(input);
        
        // Then
        assertThat(result).isNotNull();
        assertThat(result.getStatus()).isEqualTo(Status.SUCCESS);
    }
}
```

## Commit Guidelines

New format: {success: true, result: {...}}"
```

### Commit Best Practices
